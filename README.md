How to play:
I have made a Cube Cobra list here: https://cubecobra.com/cube/list/61ffd44c477ed80fb175d065
However, Cube Cobra does not support custom cards. Fortunately many of our editted cards have the same name so building your deck in cockatrice is easy.
For the cards with custom names use this spread sheet to find it's common cube counterpart name: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sWagcxX9HO7A3T_juhTTKU1Z_5V6eQNAg9rNaZ-cVTE/edit?usp=sharing
While drafting, you will not see the cards with their custom effects. To do so you can always look up their image in the "Common_Cube_Custom_Set_Cockatrice_Pics" folder.
